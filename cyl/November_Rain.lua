--November Rain
singer:Guns N'Roses

When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But darlin' when I hold you,don't know I feel the same
'Cause nothin' lasts forever and we both know heats can change
And it's hard to hold a candle in the cold november rain
We've been through this such a long long time
Just tryin' to kill the pain,oh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
Walking away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head,just knowin' that you were mine
All mine
So if you want to love me then darlin' don't refrain
Or I'll end up Walkin' in the cold november rain
Do you need some time,on your own
Do you need some time,all alone
Everybody needs some time on their own
Don't you know you need some time,all alone
I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you can heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you
Sometimes I need some time,on my own
Sometimes I need some time,all alone
Everybody needs some time on their own
Don't you know you need some time,all alone
And when you fear subside and shadows still remain
I know that you can love me when there's no one left to blame
So never mind darkness,we still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever even cold november rain
Don't ya think that you need somebody
Don't ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody
Don't ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody
Don't ya think that you need someone
Everybody needs somebody
