--Demons
singer:Imagine Dragons
When the days are cold
And the cards all fold 
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worest of all
ANd the blood's run stale
I want to hide the turth
I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside
There's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we bread
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come 
THis is my kingdom come
WHen you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
When the curtain's call
It the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
And the mess you made
Don't want to let you down
But I am hell bound
Though this is all for you
Don't want to hide the truth
No matter what we bread
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
They said it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go
Your eyes,they shine so bright
I want to save their light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how
When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
